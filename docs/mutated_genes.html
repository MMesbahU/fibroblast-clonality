Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this analysis, we look at the direct impact of somatic variants on the genes in which they are located. We combine information from the clonal trees about which variants tag which clones and <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html">VEP</a> functional annotations about the expected consequence of each variant. For each gene with a somatic variant (and sufficient gene expression), we test for differential expression between cells that have the mutation (based on clone assignment) and those that do not. We can then compare these “mutated gene” differential expression results for variants with different categories of functional annotation.</p>
<p>Clonal trees were inferred with <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/26/1522203113">Canopy</a> using variant allele frequency information from a set of strictly filtered somatic variants called from whole-exome sequencing data. We filtered somatic variants to only include variants that had read coverage in at least one single-cell for the relevant line. Assignment of cells to clones was done with <a href="https://github.com/PMBio/cardelino">cardelino</a>.</p>

<p>With this analysis, 1067 genes/variants could be tested for DE between mutated and unmutated clones.</p>
<p>We can recompute false discovery rates with IHW, simplify the VEP annotation categories (assigning all nonsense categories to “nonsense” and all splicing categories to “splicing”) and inspect the results.</p>

<p>We can also just look specifically at the boxplots of the logFC values across categories, first looking at the median logFC values and results from a t-test testing if the mean logFC value is different from zero. Positive logFC values indicate higher expression in the mutated clone, and negative logFC values lower expression in the mutated clone.</p>

<h2>DE for mutated clone: stricter filtering</h2>
<p>In the analysis above, the minimum allowed clone size (i.e. group for DE analysis) was 3 cells. Such potentially small group sizes could lead to noisy estimates of the logFC values that we looked at above. Let us repeat the above analysis but increasing the minimum number of cells for a group to 10 to try to obtain more accurate (on average) logFC estimates from the DE model.</p>
<p>Run DE testing between mutated and un-mutated clones for a more strictly filtered set of affected genes for each line.</p>

<p>With this analysis, 830 could be tested for DE between mutated and unmutated clones (237 fewer than with the lenient filtering above).</p>
<p>We can recompute false discovery rates with IHW, simplify the VEP annotation categories (assigning all nonsense categories to “nonsense” and all splicing categories to “splicing”) and inspect the results.</p>

<p>On the evidence of the plot above it does not look like stricter filtering of variants fundmentally changes the results. It still does not look possible to discern differences in the logFC distributions of mutated genes between different annotation categories for variants.</p>

<h2>DE for mutated clone: fitting PCs</h2>
<p>We can also get DE results comparing mutated clone to all unmutated clones, fitting the first couple of PCs in the model to see if this accounts for unwanted variation and increases power to detect differences in expression between mutated and unwanted clones for mutated genes.</p>

<p>In the case of the <em>COL1A1</em> gene in <code>joxm</code>, there are two splicing variants (one a splice-acceptor variant and one a more general splice-region variant), and cells in the mutated clones have significantly lower expression than the unmutated clones for this gene. For the remaining genes with more than one somatic variant, there is no significant difference in gene expression between the mutated and unmutated clones.</p>

<h3>Mutations in cell cycle genes</h3>
<p>Given the results of the transcriptome-wide differential expression analyses, it would be interesting to know if cell cycle genes specifically harbour mutations. To explore this, we first obtain the set of genes belonging to cell cycle gene sets in the MSigDB c2 gene set collection.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>We find a small number of somatic variants to associate with differential expression between mutated and unmutated cells/clones. Unfortunately, in this set of variants and lines (with relatively small sample size in terms of numbers of cells), we cannot make any claims about different effects on expression of somatic variants with different functional annotations.</p>

TeX fonts only; see
http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html.  This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
