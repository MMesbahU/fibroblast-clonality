## Project overview?

This project investigates clonality in human dermal fibroblast cell populations
in 32 cell lines from distinct donors, using bulk whole exome sequencing and 
single-cell RNA-sequencing data.

Here are the results of our analyses. They were generated by rendering
the [R Markdown documents](https://github.com/davismcc/fibroblast-clonality/tree/master/analysis) into webpages.

2. [Analysis of effects of somatic variants on cis gene expression.](mutated_genes.html)
