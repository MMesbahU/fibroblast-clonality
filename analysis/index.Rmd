## Project overview

This project investigates clonality in human dermal fibroblast cell populations
in 32 cell lines from distinct donors, using bulk whole-exome sequencing and 
single-cell RNA-sequencing data.

**Key findings:**

* A novel approach for integrating DNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data to 
reconstruct clonal substructure and single-cell transcriptomes.
* A new computational method, [cardelino](github.com/PMBio/cardelino), to map single-cell RNA-seq profiles to clones.
* Evidence for non-neutral evolution of clonal populations in human fibroblasts.
* Proliferation and cell cycle pathways are commonly distorted in mutated clonal
populations, with implications for cancer and ageing.

## Analyses

Here we present the reproducible the results of our analyses. They were 
generated by rendering
the [R Markdown documents](https://github.com/davismcc/fibroblast-clonality/tree/master/analysis) into webpages.

The results presented in the paper were produced with these analyses.
